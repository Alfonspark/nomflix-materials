# HTML5 / CSS3

You already know!

---

# JS

* What you came here for üí™üèª

--

* The most popular language in the world. ever.

--

* Started out being super ugly, but it has become **so** much better!

---

# NodeJS

* Before, Javascript could only be used on the browser.

--

* NodeJS takes Javascript **outside** of the browser.

--

* This means we can install it on any computer (like a windows, or a mac, server).

--

* So we can play with it more now, and we can use it to do stuff that will make our life and code more easy and beautiful.

---

# NPM (Node Package Manager)

* Do you want a NodeJS package? You can install it with NPM.

---

# Webpack

* This it where it gets complicated

--

* Before, when you where writing code, you were writing code for the browser, this means that you had to follow his rules.

--

* Webpack (NodeJS package) is a module bundler, that means that is gonna take all your modules (code) and bundle it (putting it together)

--

* Thanks to Webpack we can make our development workflow easier because we will want to use code that the browsers are not ready for yet but thanks to Webpack we can write new code and give old and ugly code to the browser so he can understand it.

--

No more programming for the browser.

--

* Also Webpack thinks that everything is a module, this means that we can transform _almost_ anything!

---

# ES6

* Sexy Javascript.

--

* Has very nice new features that old programmers care about.

--

* Looks cleaner so that makes it easier to learn for beginners.

--

* Some browsers don't understand it _fully_ so we need to transform it into old code (using webpack)

---

# Recap

* NodeJS is JS outside of the browser

--

* With NodeJS comes NPM

--

* With NPM we can install Webpack

--

* With Webpack we can code **super modern** code (latest features) and we can take this code and give it to old browsers.

--

* Some of this **super modern** code is ES6 or CSSNext
