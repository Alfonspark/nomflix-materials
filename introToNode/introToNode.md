# Introduction to Node

## It's JS but it doesn't feel like it

---

# Theory time

* Before we use it, there are a couple of things we should know.

--

* NPM comes with NodeJS.

--

* Most of the time (almost always) we will use NPM in the console to make NodeJS do things.

--

* `npm init`

--

* `npm install X`

--

* `npm uninstall X`

--

* ...

---

# Package.json

* JSON is "notation" langage.

--

* Just like HTML, it has some rules.

--

* Example of json:

--

```json
{
  "name": "nuber",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description":
    "Cloning Uber with NodeJS, GraphQL, Express, PostgresQL, Typescript, Webpack, React, Apollo and PWA.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/serranoarevalo/nuber",
  "author": "Nicolás Serrano Arévalo <mailto:itnico.las.me@gmail.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": false
}
```

---

# NodeJS loves package.json

* package.json gives information to NodeJS about your projects, what packages it needs and how to behave.

--

* You'll learn how to master the package.json + npm + NodeJS combination on this course.
