# CSS Grid

## Building impossible layouts with CSS

---

# History

* Before there was

```css
.child {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

--

* Then there was

```css
.father {
  display: flex;
}
```

--

* Now we have

```css
.father {
  display: grid;
}
```

---

# Grid Rules

* `display:grid;` needs to applied to the container of the elements we want to move (just like flex) and also all the other properties that affect them.

--

* A grid has rows and columns

--

* Rows and columns are separated by lines

---

# How does it look?
